# Illandril's Token Tooltips (5e)

This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that adds tooltips to tokens.

The tooltips include...
1. HP
1. AC
1. Passive Perception
1. Passive Investigation
1. Passive Insight
1. Spell Slots
1. Feat Uses
1. Item Quantity and Uses (toggle-able for each item)

Tooltips are shown for all tokens for GMs. They are shown only for Friendly tokens for players.

This currently only supports the DnD5e System (it will function on other modules, but the tooltips will likely not have enough useful information shown to be worthwhile).
